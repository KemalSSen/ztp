# Zero Trust Protocol (ZTP)

## Version
- 1.0 (Initial Draft)

## Overview
ZTP (Zero Trust Protocol) is a lightweight, encrypted, authenticated, stream-multiplexed protocol designed for secure client-server communication over untrusted networks. It leverages modern cryptography and token-based identity verification.

---

## Frame Format
Each frame is transmitted over the connection as a sequence of bytes with the following structure:

| Field       | Size (bytes) | Description                                |
|:------------|:------------|:-------------------------------------------|
| Version     | 2            | Protocol version number                   |
| Type        | 2            | Frame type (handshake, data, etc.)         |
| StreamID    | 4            | Logical stream identifier                 |
| Nonce       | 12           | Unique nonce for encryption               |
| Length      | 4            | Length of the encrypted payload           |
| Payload     | Variable     | Encrypted application or control data     |

**Total Header Size:** 24 bytes.

---

## Message Types
- **0x01 - TypeHandshakeInit**: Client sends encrypted token after handshake.
- **0x02 - TypeHandshakeAck**: (Optional) Server acknowledgment.
- **0x03 - TypeData**: Regular encrypted application or control message.
- **0x04 - TypeClose**: Closing connection or stream.

---

## Handshake Flow

1. **Key Exchange**:
   - Client and Server exchange Curve25519 public keys.
   - Each derives a shared secret.

2. **Session Key Derivation**:
   - Shared secret passed through SHA-256 to derive the session encryption key.

3. **Token Transmission**:
   - Client encrypts a signed identity token (HMAC-SHA256) using the session key.
   - Token includes:
     - ClientID
     - Role
     - Expiration Time

4. **Token Verification**:
   - Server decrypts and verifies token signature and expiration.
   - Server enforces access based on declared role.

5. **Secure Session Established**.

---

## Stream Multiplexing
- Multiple logical streams can exist simultaneously over one TCP connection.
- Stream IDs must be positive integers.
- Example assignments:
  - Stream ID `1` -> Chat messages.
  - Stream ID `2` -> Control commands (ping, status, etc.).

---

## Encryption Details
- **Cipher**: ChaCha20-Poly1305 (AEAD)
- **Nonce Size**: 12 bytes (unique per message)
- **Key Size**: 32 bytes (derived session key)
- **Payload Integrity**: Verified by Poly1305 tag

---

## Security Guarantees
- Confidentiality: All payloads are encrypted.
- Integrity: AEAD ensures tamper detection.
- Authentication: Clients authenticate via signed tokens.
- Authorization: Enforced by role-based token verification.
- Replay Protection (Coming Soon): Unique nonces per message prevent replays.

---

## Future Extensions
- Session Resumption
- Heartbeat Frames
- Stream Priority
- Compression
- Advanced Replay Protection (Anti-Replay Window)

📋 ZTP Protocol (Current State)

Step	Client	Server	Description
1	Generate ECDH key pair	Generate ECDH key pair	🔐
2	Send public key	Receive public key	🔐
3	Receive public key	Send public key	🔐
4	Derive shared session key	Derive shared session key	🔐
5	Send encrypted identity token (with clientID + role)	Verify token, authenticate role	🔑
6	Start sending frames on streams	Dispatch frames to correct handler	🚀
7	Each frame carries: StreamID + Encrypted Payload + Nonce	Each stream has a handler and timeout	🛤️
8	Server responds back encrypted per stream	Client reads replies	🔁
9	Streams auto-close if inactive for 30 sec	Cleanup done safely	🧹
💬 Streams Behavior

StreamID	Purpose	Example Commands
1	Chat Stream	hello, any normal text
2	Control Stream	ping, status, time, echo
✅ What this gave us
True multi-stream communication over one TCP session.

Role-based authorization at session start.

End-to-end encryption on every frame.

Automatic stream management with timeouts.

Super modular, extensible design.
